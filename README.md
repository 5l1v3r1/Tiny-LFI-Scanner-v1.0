---------------------------=[ Tiny LFI ScanneR  1.0 ]=-----------------------------
                               By Tr00ps & Xylitol


Tiny LFI ScanneR  1.0, is the continuation of Tiny XSS Scanner v1.0
for easy found LFI (local File Include) with google dorking
Source code inclued, it's a little bit different from Tiny XSS Scanner
We have  innovated :]
the file "Tiny LFI scanner v1.0.exe" is packed with UPX v3.03
inclued 2 DLL if you dont have the VB runtime, and the Vista style :]

I have says:


"too many pissing peoples says blah blah this scanner dont work etc...
if the scanner make shit it's because you are spotted by google like link http://sorry.google.com/sorry/?continue
etc..."

now the problem is solved the scanner says to you if your IP is banned or not ;)


PS: in virustotal.com my Scanner have maked again a resulte like: 2/39 (5.13%) 
eSafe says Suspicious File
F-Secure says Suspicious:W32/Malware!Gemini
it's not a malware that a false positive because it's packed with UPX
unpack it and re test in virustotal you found 0/39 (0.00%)   ;)




Enjoy the fun
